# IssueTracker__CN
A web application that helps to track the issues. In this we can create a new project and add any number of issues to that project. An issue contains the title, author,
description and different issue tags. We can filter the issues out based on different tags assigned to the issues as well as by the author names. We can search the issues from 
the issue list by issue title or by the issue description. We can delete any issue of project or we can delete the project itself.
